				<h2>The story</h2>
				<p>The story of the Yellow Umbrella begins in the episode No
  				   Tomorrow. It was St. Patrick's Day and Barney and Ted went
				   to a party, the mother was also at that party carrying the 
				   yellow umbrella with her at the entrance. After a wild night
				   at the party, Ted got punched in the face for charging drinks
				   to someone else's account. After that Ted tells Marshall what
				   happened that night, and tells him that he forgot his phone,
				   so Ted went back to the party to look for his phone but
				   couldn't find it. He was just about to leave, but it was
				   raining, so he went back in and found the yellow umbrella.
				   He took the umbrella and left.</p>
				<p>In Big Days, Ted is seen
				   attending a wedding, which turns out to be Barney's, in 2013,
				   after which he will meet the mother. As it rains, he tells
				   Marshall that he didn't bring an umbrella, a reference to the
				   mother's yellow umbrella he obtained years beforehand.</p>
				<p>In No Pressure, after Ted gains closure with Robin, he walks
				   outside to everyone outside with a yellow umbrella. This
				   symbolises his opportunities after he gets over Robin.</p>
