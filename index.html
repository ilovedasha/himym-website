                    <div class="line yellow"></div>
                    <p>The Yellow Umbrella is an object originally owned by The 
                       Mother, which comes into the possession of Ted after she 
                       leaves it at a party. It is often used to represent her 
                       since she remains faceless. The umbrella is the ultimate symbol of 
                       coincidence, uniqueness and true love in the show. As you 
                       know, Ted met The Mother under this very umbrella.</p>

                    <div class="line blue"></div>
                    <p>The Blue French Horn first appeared in the Pilot episode, in 
                       which Ted steals it for Robin after she saw it in a 
                       restaurant called Carmichaels and he said it reminded him of
                       a "Smurf penis" and she said she'd like one for her 
                       apartment. From this point onwards, Robin kept it on the 
                       mantle in her apartment. In fact, Ted stole it a several times 
                       over the show.</p>

                    <p>The tie is originally worn by Marshall, but after making fun
                       of it, Barney ends up having to wear it as a result of losing a
                       bet with Marshall and Lily. From then on Barney is seen wearing
                       it in every episode. It is even seen wrapped around Barney's
                       arm in The Slutty Pumpkin Returns, when Barney turns up almost
                       naked in the Halloween Party on the roof of The Apartment's building.</p>

                    <p>Ted's Red Cowboy Boots, as the name suggests, were a pair of
                       red colored cowboy boots which were owned by Ted Mosby. He is
                       under the impression that he can "pull them off", but everyone
                       else thinks otherwise. However, a gay couple believed Ted can
                       pull them off after he asked them because of their "impeccable
                       taste and style". He also states that they are "more of a burgundy"
                       in The Wedding Bride.</p>
